<h3>Malting</h3>
<p>The barley plant has lots of grains on the stalk, these are the plants seeds. The seeds are full of starch which are complex chains of sugars - also known as carbhoydrates.
    <br>Before we can brew alcohol we need to convert these starches into sugar. The easiest way is to let the plant do it naturally! We fool the grain into thinking it's spring time, by adding water and warming it up.
    <br>This sets off a chain reaction inside the grain, enzymes are released which "cut" the links between the sugar chains and the starch turns into simple sugars called Maltose.

<h3>Mashing</h3>
<p>Once we have malted & dried the grain, they are now packed full of sugar. To access this sugar we need to soak the grains in hot water until the sugar dissolves into the water!
    <br>This is called an infusion mash... think of it like making a big cup of tea! The more grain you add, the more sugar you will have, and the stronger the alcohol will be.
    <br>Once all of your sugar has dissolved, you must separate the grain from your sugary liquid. This sugary liquid is called "wort".
    <br>The spent grain is now a waste product, and can be sold to farmers to be used for pig feed!

<h3>Boiling</h3>
<p>The boiling stage is very important. This is where the wort is sanitised by the heat, which helps to ward of bacteria so the yeast can work their magic in peace.
    <br>During this stage we also add our hops to the boil. The essential oils in the hops are dissolved into the beer and provide a bitter flavour. Without them the final beer would be overly sweet and not very good!
    <br>The hops not only add flavour to the beer, but they have natural antiseptic properties which helps the beer to last longer without spoiling.

<h3>Fermentation</h3>
<p>After the sugary liquid has been boiled and hops are added the liquid is now called "green wort". Before fermentation we must cool the liquid down, otherwise we will scald the yeast.
    <br>Once the liquid is cooled, we now have a bitter/sweet concoction and we can add our yeast to the fermentation vessel. This is where the magic happens!
    <br>The yeast consume the sugar, and start to multiple. Sometimes the yeast will froth over the top of the fermentation vessel.
    <br>The yeast consume all of the sugar, which is their food source. Their waste products are carbon dioxide and alcohol!
    <br>The fermentation can take anywhere from 2 weeks for an ale, to almost 3 months for some styles of lager.
    <br>After this process is complete, the yeast fall asleep and lie dormant until the next brew begins!

<h3>Packaging</h3>
<p>Once the beer is ready and has had time to condition, it is then put into packaging and shipped to pubs & supermarkets.
    <br>There are many types of packaging. For draught beer, served in pubs there are casks and kegs which hold 72 or 88 pints!
    <br>For supermarkets the beer can be packaged into bottles or cans... usually in 500ml, 440ml or 330ml varieties!
    <br>After this, all you have to do is chill your beer, crack it open, and enjoy!
