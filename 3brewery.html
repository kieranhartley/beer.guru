    <h1>Improving Productivity With IT</h1>
    <h3>Unit 1, Outcome 1</h3>
    <h3>1.1	Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h3>
    <p> In order to create a successful business, you need information on which to base your decisions. This is just as true today as it was centuries ago, successful businesses would have gathered, analysed and acted upon various information. 
        Imagine a brewery in 1500AD England. It would need to know how many sales they are expected to generate based on the previous year figures. They would need information from the hop farms and barley farms to forecast the supply of raw ingredients. They would need to work out their fixed & variable costs, yields, wastage and profit margins.
        These bits of information may have arrived in many forms. They could be general business surveys. Letters from suppliers or vendors. Internal records from previous years. Anecdotes passed on via word of mouth from customers and publicans. Published articles and books. 
        The more information they made available to themselves, the more successful the business could become.
        In the modern age, this is just as true, but businesses now have many more sources of information, more ways to gather that information and an ever-increasing number of ways to process it. Hospitals have access to all different kinds of equipment which can perform scans of the human body and output it into electronic form. Police departments no longer need entire rooms to file and store data, they can fit this information onto a pocket-sized hard drive. It should be noted however, that with these increases in technology, come risks to data security.
        Advancements in Information Technology mean that we now have access to: quicker communication, electronic databases, more robust storage and retrieval novel ways to capture data and novel ways to process and analyse that data. If we focus just on digital IT businesses, some of the main advancements in technology that we have seen in the last decade or so include: increased processing power of CPUs & GPUs, faster and more robust storage, faster broadband, wireless technology, cloud technology, machine learning (AI) and cryptography.

    <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully ‚Äì what do you need to make projects successful?</h3>
    
    <p>Tools: Coding Environment, Communication tools (slack, zoom), Planning/progress (Trello)
    <p>Skills: Communication, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Email, Planning, Executing, Reviewing.<br> <br>
    <h4>Method</h4>
        
    <p>To create a digital project first you must ensure that each member of the team has access to the same software that is going to be used to create the project. If it involves coding, access to the same development environment tool is crucial to ensure that each member of the team can collaborate on the project effectively. 
        On this project we used Visual Studio Code. It is one of the most popular source-code editors in the world due to being open-source and free. Some of the features that make VSC even more appealing are the built in support for git and Github, allowing you to seamlessly keep track of your different versions and upload them to be shared.
        In addition to this, VSC has many extensions & plug-ins that streamline functions between other software that you may be using on the project. These extensions help to improve your productivity. LiveServer allows you to host a local server which updates any changes to your code in real-time. Prettier enforces a single style of code formatting, which saves time spent formatting the code ‚Äì this is especially useful when multiple people are coding the same project. VSC even has a Slack Chat extension which makes it easier to share files, and allows you to embed a chat box into the environment which is useful for chatting to your team whilst sharing your screen and coding.
    <br>
    <h4>Communication tools</h4>
        <p>Working on digital projects opens the door to collaborating with team mates whilst working from entirely different locations. With this in mind, whilst working remotely online, it becomes much more important to use communication tools to ensure teams are still working closely together, avoiding errors, and not wasting time.
        On the project we have used Slack. Not only does it allow clear communication. It also allows communications to be directed to different public channels, private channels and direct messages. It also allows for the uploading of files, sharing code using code blocks and acts as a directory of people working on a team. Slack essentially functions as an archive of an entire project. If channels are used correctly it is possible to go back through and check the progress of the entire project.
    <h4>Project Management</h4>
        <p>Similarly, to communication, it is very important to have a robust Project Management system when working remotely and collaborating with teams over the internet. This ensures that tasks can be split up and delegated to team members, allows all team members to view the progress of a project, lets completed tasks be archived and new tasks can be allocated. We used Trello, which allows you to break the project into many smaller tasks, quickly allocate them, and ensure that the entire team is working towards the same goal.

    </p>
    <h3>1.3	Plan and carry out tasks using IT ‚Äì e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h3>
    <p>
        To begin planning our project we first joined a large conference call on Zoom. Zoom allows up to 100 users to join a conference call with webcam video and audio function. Our instructors lead the meeting, and made use of the screenshare function to display their screen and guide us through. Often a screenshare is worth a thousand words.
        After our lesson we then began planning our projects on our own. I first used pen and paper to create a mind-map to help me visualise the project and break it down into smaller parts that would need to be completed. I then transferred these ideas from paper to computer using Trello to manage this project and started by making three columns: ‚ÄúTo Do / Doing / Done‚Äù.
        Any research that needed to be completed was assigned to a Trello card. I then added Trello cards for the tasks required to build the website.
        The key functions of Trello that I made use of for this project were the ‚ÄúLists‚Äù, ‚ÄúDescriptions‚Äù, ‚ÄúDue Date‚Äù & ‚ÄúCompleted‚Äù. 
        The descriptions are very useful as they allow you to write your own notes, or even copy and paste guidelines from other sources for you to follow through. The lengthy notes you take are hidden within the card so they do not clutter your screen. If you need to remind yourself of the details of a task, you simply click the card and can access the writing.
        By following my ‚ÄúDue Dates‚Äù I was able to track my progress and stick to my own deadlines. If a deadline was going to be missed, I could assess why I missed my deadline, reassign a new deadline and ensure the project continued on course.

    </p>        
    <h3>1.4	Describe the risks that might impact digital projects ‚Äì what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3>
    <p>
        <h4>Lack of Prioritisation </h4>
        <p>If priorities are not set in stone then the project may start to suffer. If the entire team are not aware of the key priorities of the project then time could be wasted on smaller, less important modules instead of focusing on the main elements ‚Äì it could even be totally innocent and due to lack of guidance.
        <h4>Poor communication between Project Manager & teams</h4>
        <p>The project manager acts as the middle man/woman between the clients/stakeholders needs and wants and the issues raised by their team. If the project manager does not give out clear advice, and ask for regular feedback then the project may begin to go off track. The project manager needs to interpret the client‚Äôs requests, and guide the team on how to do it. However, it is very important to note that the team of coders are just as important as they are working on the front line and with their point of view, they will be able to spot problems or issues before they arise. It is important that teams are given chance to air their concerns without being ignored or criticised.
        <h4>Poor communication between Project Manager & clients or stakeholders</h4>
        <p>Project managers also need to be able to speak freely to the clients or stakeholders and not have to fear criticism for being honest. One frequent problem seen in the tech industry and creative industries is that clients will expect far more work than their budget allows. The project manager needs to be able to manage their expectations and inform them of what their budget will allow, or advise them to increase their budget. Regular check-ins with clients should be conducted so that the client can see the progress of the project, be made aware of any issues or problems, and change the direction of the project if necessary.

    <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software ‚Äì how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
    
    <h4>Assess the needs vs. the budget.</h4>
    <p>
        Clarify what functions the IT system needs, and what software, hardware and other peripherals are required. You should have a good idea of the bare minimum required. Any items that are a priority should be noted, and any items that are not 100% necessary can be put on hold and added add the end if budget allows for it.
        Any software or hardware that is not 100% necessary should be cut. The funds could be better spent elsewhere. For your most important pieces of software and hardware ‚Äì it may be worth thinking about investing more heavily in them, this will cost more in the short term but will pay off in the long term and help to futureproof the companies project.
        
    <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. ‚Äì How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3>
    <p>
        I always find large projects quite hard to start. Uncertainty often causes me to procrastinate and worry too much about starting a task. I‚Äôve always been advised that large projects should be broken down into smaller chunks and worked on bit by bit. Trello is absolutely perfect for doing this. Trello allows you to break down a project into smaller ‚Äúcards‚Äù and lets your visualise your project before it is created. You can then track the progress of your project and priortise certain cards as you see fit.
        Zoom has allowed me to communicate with instructors and other team mates face to face. I often find that text based communications are a little bit lacking in body language and certain communications can be misread over text. When you can see a persons face and hear the tone of their voice you can understand their intentions more and it gives a better feel of humanity. However, conversely, too much time spent on zoom can waste time and be a distraction. Everything in moderation!
        Slack allows quick and concise text communication and also acts as a directory so you can see every person that is on your team. You are able to communicate in private direct messages, as a whole channel, or break off into smaller teams. You also have the option to set channels as private or public. Files, photos & other attachments can be sent to the entire project team, as well as codeblocks to copy and paste short snippets of code. If you keep the main channels free from random chatter then it is very easy to go back through the conversation and see the progress of the project from start to finish.
    <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects ‚Äì How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
    <h4>Removing Net Neutrality</h4>
    <p>
        There has been lots of controversy around this topic, especially in the United States. Net Neutrality is the principle that all websites should be treated equally in regards to bandwidth and resources. The suggested idea is that this neutrality could be removed and large corporations could pay money to have access to more bandwidth and better search engine results ‚Äì effectively squashing smaller companies websites out of the market. If this idea was to take off it could change the internet as we know it. This would have serious implications to any digital project that was half way through production, as any plans related to bandwidth and search engine optimisation would have to be adjusted. It would also require changes to the business model of the project as it may severely reduce your total number of users, require you to increase your subscription price, or require that your marketing budget is increased to gain the same number of users to be profitable.
    <h4>Excessive government internet restrictions</h4>
    <p>
        In China, the internet is heavily restricted and most websites on the internet is blacklisted by default. The government decides which websites are allowed to be viewed and these are added to the whitelist that users can access. If you were working on a project and were planning on deploying it in China, then your project could be heavily effected or even totally banned by new government regulations. Additionally, already established websites have a significant advantage compared to new competitors. Alibaba and Baidu enjoy great benefits from restricted internet access as international companies are totally barred from entering the market and competing. The restrictions can also have the opposite effect and pose an advantage for new competitors. In 2020 there is increasing worry that the Chinese company Zoom is capable of spying on users meetings. This means that companies, especially in the USA, may refuse to use the Zoom service if they are discussing very sensitive data or corporate secrets. This provides a great opportunity for a US company to provide a similar, more secure service to replace Zoom in the USA.

<h3>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h3> 
<h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed ‚Äì in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
<p>To code the website, I have used the basic windows notepad to take notes and plan out each page. I then planned to write the code out in Visual Studio Code referring back to my notes. I find using notepad first allows me to get my thoughts down quickly without cluttering up a fresh page on Visual Studio Code which will later need to have tags inserted and may lead to errors. After some brief research I found that developers do use other code editors such as sublime text or brackets. However, Visual Studio Code seems to be amongst the industry leaders so I will continue with this. 

<h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3>
<p>In terms of coding the html and CSS, I find this to be the most appropriate software to use. In the past (whilst at school) I have used Adobe Dreamweaver so I researched if it is still popular. After researching on forums I learned that most web developers do not bother with Dreamweaver anymore, and instead the code directly into a source code editor like Visual Studio Code, Brackets or Sublime. There is an alternative option, using a website builder such as Squarespace, or Wordpress ‚Äì but as they come with preloaded themes, this would not be appropriate for my learning.
    
<h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project ‚Äì are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3>
<p>I am happy with my final project. It has incorporated use of some illustrations which I made myself and some open source, free .png clipart. I am happy with the colour palette I chose to use. My favourite colours are blue, white and dark grey. I am also happy with the logo that I created in photoshop. I feel that the navigation bar at the top of the page is sleek and minimalistic and adds to the minimal feel of the website. One issue I have with the website is that I would have liked to have included a page about the operations inside a brewery, however I did not have time to create the artwork and I couldn‚Äôt find any free, open source images that were suitable.

<h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3>
<p>I would like to incorporate some fancier graphics and animations, which would allow me to showcase my JavaScript abilities. I also feel that I could improve the layout of my images. The font used could be improved upon to include more variation in fonts.

<h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
<p>I feel that the outcome of my project is a good effort at showcasing the skills I have learnt during my bootcamp at CodeNation. I still have a lot to learn but I am very encouraged by the teaching I received and my ability to turn this into working code.

<h3>Unit 1, Outcome 3 (Review)</h3>
<h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency ‚Äì could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
<p>I find that I often hesitate to begin projects because I find them overwhelming to begin with. Once I have done some research and broke down the project into smaller tasks, I find that my productivity is good.

<h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
<p>To improve my productivity, I should immediately break down my project into smaller chunks and input the tasks onto a project management suite such as Trello. I can then begin researching, and marking off each chunk of research on Trello as I go. I often find Zoom meetings quite distracting if they are running in the background whilst I am working and this can slow my productivity. Fortunately, on this task I was allowed to leave the meeting so I could focus on deep work alone. Communication with my instructors Liam & Jay and ensuring I returned at set times to re-join Zoom for update meetings worked really well for me.
    

<h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects ‚Äì what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3>
<p>To improve my productivity, I will research the additional functions of slack. I feel that I have a good grasp of the software but there are still many functions I haven‚Äôt tried to use myself, and probably many more I don‚Äôt even know exist. Similarly, with Trello, I feel that I could improve my knowledge of all the functions and make them work seamlessly together to streamline my operation and improve productivity.

<h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3>
<p>To test digital solutions, I would make sure that my final project is tested on different platforms. Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and mobile platforms such as iOS and Android. Similarly, within the platforms I would make sure that testing is done on different variations of software. If I am coding in JavaScript, does it run as a standalone app? What about as an applet? Does the code run correctly when it is incorporated into a html website?
    
<h3>Unit 2, Outcome 1</h3>
<h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3>
<p>
    The overall theme for the website is a dark grey background, with a light shade of grey font. There is a top navigation bar that also has the same colour theme, and a bright blue modifier to show which page is currently being displayed.
    The pages follow a similar theme, and any graphics that have been incorporated, were created by myself and saved as a PNG file with transparency option so as to remove the plain white background you would find on a JPEG file.
    
<h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
<p>
    Any images used on my website have been created by myself, illustrating them in photoshop as vector files and then saving them as compressed PNG files. For the more technical images such as the image of the beer bottles, I ensured this was sourced from a website that provides open source, creative commons images that are free for personal & commercial use.

<h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3>
<p>
In terms of access issues, I have written the website to account for people that may suffer from impairments, taking particular care to include those with visual or cognitive impairments. Each paragraph has an accompanying diagram that matches the paragraph. I have also labelled my images with alt descriptions to include those using a screen reader.

<h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
<p>
    Appropriate filetypes for websites include:<br><br>
    HTML files ‚Äì Hyper Text Markup Language. This is the skeleton of a website.<br><br>
    CSS files ‚Äì Cascading Style Sheets. These give you the ability to change the visual elements in the html code. I have used this in my website to change the background colour, font types, sizes and colour and also to set a theme for my navigation bar.<br><br>
    PNG files ‚Äì PNG files are image files that allow transparency. You can see these used throughout my website. The transparency allows the image to be displayed over the top of the dark background without having any white ‚Äúsquare‚Äù background behind it.<br><br>
    JPG files ‚Äì JPEG files are best for photos, as they allow the image to be compressed without ruining the image. My website only used simple graphics, to keep the file size small, and therefore I have chosen not to use JPEG on this project.<br><br>
    GIF ‚Äì GIF files allow for images that have moving animation. <br><br>
    MP3 ‚Äì MP3 files are audio files that have been compressed. They are very useful for web design. I have no included any MP3 files, but I would like to add some at a later date if I add some animated GIFS.
