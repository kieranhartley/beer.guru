    <h1>Ingredients of Beer</h1>
    <p>Beer is made from 4 different ingredients. Malted Barley, hops, water & yeast.
    <br>We soak the barley to release sugars, add hops for a sharp flavour and then use yeast to convert the sugars in to alcohol. 
    <br>Water is the medium that this chemical reaction takes place inside.</p>

    <h3>Water</h3>
    <p>Water is a very important part of the beer making process. 
    <br>If your beer is 5% alcohol, then the remaining 95% is water.
    <br>The water must be filtered and treated before brewing.
    </p>

    <h3>Malted Barley</h3>
    <p>Barley is a grain, similar to wheat, oats or rice. It is full of starch.
    <br>The starch must be converted into sugars before we can create alcohol.
    <br>This break down of starch into sugars happens during a process called malting & mashing.

    <h3>Hops</h3>
    <p>Hops are a flower from a vine plant. They are full of essential oils which give a crisp, bitter flavour.
        <br>Hops also have a natural antiseptic in their oils which helps to preserve the beer.

    <h3>Yeast</h3>
    <p>Yeast is a tiny single cell organism that is part of the Funghus family.
        <br> Yeast eat sugars and create alcohol and carbon dioxide as their waste product.
